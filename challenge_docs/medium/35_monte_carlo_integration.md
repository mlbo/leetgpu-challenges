# Monte Carlo Integration

Implement Monte Carlo integration on a GPU. Given a set of function values $y\_i = f(x\_i)$ sampled at random points $x\_i$ uniformly distributed in the interval $[a, b]$, estimate the definite integral:

$$
\int\_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx (b - a) \cdot \frac{1}{n} \sum\_{i=1}^{n} y\_i
$$

The Monte Carlo method approximates the integral by computing the average of the function values and multiplying by the interval width.

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `result` variable
* Solutions are tested with absolute tolerance of 1e-2 and relative tolerance of 1e-2

## Example:

```
Input:  a = 0, b = 2, n_samples = 8
        y_samples = [0.0625, 0.25, 0.5625, 1.0, 1.5625, 2.25, 3.0625, 4.0]
Output: result = 3.1875
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `n_samples` <= 100,000,000
* -1000.0 <= `a` < `b` <= 1000.0
* -10000.0 <= function values <= 10000.0
* The tolerance is set to 1e-2 to account for the inherent randomness in Monte Carlo methods and floating-point precision variations.
* Performance is measured with `n_samples` = 10,000,000
