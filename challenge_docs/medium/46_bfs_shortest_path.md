# BFS Shortest Path

Implement a program that finds the shortest path in an unweighted 2D grid using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Given a grid with obstacles and start/end positions, return the minimum number of steps needed to reach the destination.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* Return the shortest path length, or -1 if no path exists
* Grid cells with value 0 are free, cells with value 1 are obstacles
* Movement is allowed in 4 directions: up, down, left, right

## Example 1:

```
Input:
  grid (4x4) = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0]
  ]
  start_row = 0, start_col = 0
  end_row = 3, end_col = 3

Output: 6

Explanation: One possible shortest path:
(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
  grid (3x3) = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0]
  ]
  start_row = 0, start_col = 0
  end_row = 0, end_col = 2

Output: -1

Explanation: No path exists due to obstacles completely blocking the way.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `rows`, `cols` <= 1000
* Grid values are either 0 (free) or 1 (obstacle)
* Start and end positions are guaranteed to be within bounds and on free cells (value 0)
* Start and end positions may be the same (return 0 in this case)
* Performance is measured with `cols` = 500, `rows` = 500
