# Softmax

Write a program that computes the softmax function for an array of 32-bit floating-point numbers on a GPU. The softmax function is defined as follows:

For an input array $x$ of length $n$, the softmax of $x$, denoted $\sigma(x)$, is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is:

$\sigma(x)\_i = \frac{e^{x\_i}}{\sum\_{j=1}^{n} e^{x\_j}}$

Your solution should handle potential overflow issues by using the "max trick". Subtract the maximum value of the input array from each element before exponentiation.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the array `output`

## Example 1:

```
Input: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], N = 3
Output: [0.090, 0.244, 0.665] (approximately)
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: [-10.0, -5.0, 0.0, 5.0, 10.0], N = 5
Output: [2.04e-09, 4.52e-07, 9.99e-01, 2.26e-02, 9.77e-01] (approximately)
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 500,000
* Performance is measured with `N` = 500,000
