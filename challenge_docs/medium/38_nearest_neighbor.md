# Nearest Neighbor

Implement a GPU program that, for `N` three-dimensional points stored on the device, fills `indices[i]` with the index `j ≠ i` of the point closest to `points[i]`. Comparing *squared* Euclidean distance is sufficient—you do **not** need to compute square-roots.

## Implementation Requirements

* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* External libraries are not permitted
* The final result must be stored in the `indices` array

## Example 1:

```
Input:  points  = [(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (5,5,5)]
        indices = [-1, -1, -1]
        N       = 3
Output: indices = [1, 0, 1]   # 0⇆1 are nearest, 2 is closest to 1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 100,000
* Coordinates are 32-bit floats in the range [-1000, 1000]
* Performance is measured with `N` = 10,000
