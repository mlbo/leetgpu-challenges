# Gaussian Blur

Implement a program that applies a Gaussian blur filter to a 2D image. Given an input image represented as a floating-point array and a Gaussian kernel, the program should compute the convolution of the image with the kernel.
All inputs and outputs are stored in row-major order.

The Gaussian blur is performed by convolving each pixel with a weighted average of its neighbors, where the weights are determined by the Gaussian kernel. For each output pixel at position (i, j), the value is calculated as:

$$
output[i, j] = \sum\_{m=-k\_h/2}^{k\_h/2} \sum\_{n=-k\_w/2}^{k\_w/2} input[i+m, j+n] \times kernel[m+k\_h/2, n+k\_w/2]
$$

where $k\_h$ and $k\_w$ are the kernel height and width.

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` array
* Handle boundary conditions by using zero-padding (treat values outside the image boundary as zeros)

## Example 1:

```
Input:
  image (5, 5) = [
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0],
    [6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0],
    [11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0],
    [16.0, 17.0, 18.0, 19.0, 20.0],
    [21.0, 22.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0]
  ]

  kernel (3, 3) = [
    [0.0625, 0.125, 0.0625],
    [0.125, 0.25, 0.125],
    [0.0625, 0.125, 0.0625]
  ]

Output:
  output (5, 5) = [
    [1.6875, 2.75, 3.5, 4.25, 3.5625],
    [4.75, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 7.25],
    [8.5, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 11.0],
    [12.25, 17.0, 18.0, 19.0, 14.75],
    [11.0625, 15.25, 16.0, 16.75, 12.9375]
  ]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
  image (3, 3) = [
    [10.0, 20.0, 30.0],
    [40.0, 50.0, 60.0],
    [70.0, 80.0, 90.0]
  ]

  kernel (3, 3) = [
    [0.1, 0.1, 0.1],
    [0.1, 0.2, 0.1],
    [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]
  ]

Output:
  output (3, 3) = [
    [13.0, 23.0, 19.0],
    [31.0, 50.0, 39.0],
    [31.0, 47.0, 37.0]
  ]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `input_rows`, `input_cols` <= 4096
* 3 <= `kernel_rows`, `kernel_cols` <= 21
* Both `kernel_rows` and `kernel_cols` will be odd numbers
* All kernel values will be non-negative and sum to 1.0 (normalized)
* Performance is measured with `input_cols` = 512, `input_rows` = 512, `kernel_cols` = 7, `kernel_rows` = 7
