# FP16 Batched Matrix Multiplication

Implement a batched matrix multiplication in FP16. Given a batch of matrices `A` of shape `[B, M, K]` and a batch of matrices `B` of shape `[B, K, N]`, compute the output batch `C` of shape `[B, M, N]` such that for each batch index `b`:

$$
C\_b = A\_b \times B\_b
$$

All matrices are stored in row-major order and use 16-bit floating point numbers (FP16/`half`). Accumulation during multiplication should use FP32 for better precision before converting the final result to FP16.

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* Accumulation during multiplication should use FP32 for better precision before converting the final result to FP16
* The final result must be stored in the `C` array as `half`

## Example 1:

```
Input:
B = 2, M = 2, K = 3, N = 2
A = [
  [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]],
  [[7.0, 8.0, 9.0], [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]]
]
B = [
  [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]],
  [[6.0, 5.0], [4.0, 3.0], [2.0, 1.0]]
]
Output:
C = [
  [[22.0, 28.0], [49.0, 64.0]],
  [[92.0, 68.0], [128.0, 95.0]]
]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `B` <= 128
* 1 <= `M`, `N`, `K` <= 1024
* Performance is measured with `K` = 256, `M` = 256, `N` = 256
