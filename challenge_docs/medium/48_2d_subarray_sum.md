# 2D Subarray Sum

Implement a program that computes the sum of a 2D subarray of 32-bit integers.
You are given an input 2D array `input` of length `N x M`, and two row indices `S_ROW` and `E_ROW` and two column indices `S_COL` and `E_COL`.
`S_ROW`, `E_ROW`, `S_COL` and `E_COL` are inclusive, 0-based start and end indices — compute the sum of `input[S_ROW..E_ROW][S_COL..E_COL]`.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` variable

## Example 1:

```
Input:  input = [[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 1]]

        S_ROW = 0, E_ROW = 1, S_COL = 1, E_COL = 2
Output: output = 11
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:  input = [[5, 10],
                 [5, 2]]
        S_ROW = 0, E_ROW = 0, S_COL = 1, E_COL = 1
Output: output = 10
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N, M` <= 10,000
* 1 <= `input[i]` <= 10
* 0 <= `S_ROW` <= `E_ROW` <= `N - 1`
* 0 <= `S_COL` <= `E_COL` <= `M - 1`
* Performance is measured with `M` = 10,000, `N` = 10,000
