# Segmented Exclusive Prefix Sum

Given an array of `N` 32-bit floating point `values` and an integer array
`flags` of the same length, where `flags[i] = 1` marks the start of a new
segment and `flags[i] = 0` continues the current segment, compute the
**exclusive prefix sum within each segment** and store the result in
`output`. The first element is always a segment start
(`flags[0] = 1`). Within each segment, `output[i]` equals the sum of all
`values` elements in the same segment that appear before index `i`, so the
first element of every segment is always `0.0`.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in `output`
* Read from `values` and `flags`; write to `output`

## Example

```
Input values: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
Input flags:  [  1,   0,   0,   1,   0,   1]

Segments:     [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] | [4.0, 5.0] | [6.0]

Output:       [0.0, 1.0, 3.0,   0.0, 4.0,   0.0]
```

Segment 1: exclusive prefix sums of [1, 2, 3] → [0, 1, 3]  
Segment 2: exclusive prefix sums of [4, 5] → [0, 4]  
Segment 3: exclusive prefix sums of [6] → [0]

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 100,000,000
* `flags[0] = 1` always (the first element starts the first segment)
* `flags[i]` ∈ {0, 1} for all `i`
* Values are 32-bit floats in the range [-100, 100]
* Performance is measured with `N` = 50,000,000
