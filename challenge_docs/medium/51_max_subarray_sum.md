# Max Subarray Sum

Implement a program that computes the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length exactly `window_size`. You are given an array `input` of length `N` consisting of 32-bit signed integers, and an integer `window_size`.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` variable

## Example 1:

```
Input:  input = [1, 2, 4, 2, 3], window_size = 2
Output: output = 6
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:  input = [-1, -4, -2, 1], window_size = 3
Output: output = -5
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 50,000
* -10 <= `input[i]` <= 10
* 1 <= `window_size` <= `N`
* Performance is measured with `N` = 50,000
