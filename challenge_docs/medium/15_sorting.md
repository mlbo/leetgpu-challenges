# Sorting

Write a program that sorts an array of 32-bit floating-point numbers in ascending order. You are free to choose any sorting algorithm.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The sorted result must be stored back in the input `data` array

## Example

```
Input: data = [5.0, 2.0, 8.0, 1.0, 9.0, 4.0], N = 6
Output: data = [1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 8.0, 9.0]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 1,000,000
* Performance is measured with `N` = 1,000,000
