# Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication

Implement a GPU program that performs sparse matrix-vector multiplication.
Given a sparse matrix $A$ of dimensions $M \times N$ and a dense vector $x$ of length $N$,
compute the product vector $y = A \times x$, which will have length $M$. `A` is stored in row-major order.
`nnz` is the number of non-zero elements in `A`.

Mathematically, the operation is defined as:

$$
y\_i = \sum\_{j=0}^{N-1} A\_{ij} \cdot x\_j \quad \text{for} \quad i = 0, 1, \ldots, M-1
$$

The matrix $A$ is approximately 60 - 70% sparse.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only GPU native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in vector `y`

## Example:

Input:  
Matrix $A$ ($3 \times 4$):

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
5.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 \\
0.0 & 2.0 & 3.0 & 0.0 \\
0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 4.0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Vector $x$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1.0 \\
2.0 \\
3.0 \\
4.0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Output:  
Vector $y$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
9.0 \\
13.0 \\
16.0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Constraints

* 1 <= `M`, `N` <= 10,000
* The matrix $A$ is approximately 60-70% sparse (i.e., 60-70% of elements are zero)
* Performance is measured with `M` = 1,000, `N` = 10,000
