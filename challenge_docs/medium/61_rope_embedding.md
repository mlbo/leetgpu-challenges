# Rotary Positional Embedding

Implement a GPU program that computes the Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for a batch of query vectors.
RoPE is a method for encoding positional information in transformer models by rotating the query and key vectors using precomputed cosine and sine components.

Mathematically, given a query vector $x$ and corresponding cosine and sine vectors, the operation is defined as:

$$
\text{RoPE}(x) = x \odot \cos + \text{rotate\\_half}(x) \odot \sin
$$

Where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication. The $\text{rotate\\_half}(x)$ operation swaps the first and second halves of the vector and negates the first half. For a vector of dimension $d$:

$$
\text{rotate\\_half}([x\_1, \dots, x\_{d/2}, x\_{d/2+1}, \dots, x\_d]) = [-x\_{d/2+1}, \dots, -x\_d, x\_1, \dots, x\_{d/2}]
$$

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The input tensors `Q`, `cos`, and `sin` have shape `(M, D)`, where `M` is the number of tokens and `D` is the head dimension
* `D` (head dimension) is guaranteed to be an even number
* The final result must be stored in the output variable with the same shape `(M, D)`

## Example 1:

```
Input:  Q   = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],
               [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
        Cos = [[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
               [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]
        Sin = [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
               [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
Output: result = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],
                  [-1.0, -1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
        (Row 0 is identity via Cos; Row 1 is rotated via Sin)
```

## Constraints

* `Q`, `cos`, and `sin` have identical dimensions
* `D` % 2 == 0
* 1 <= `M`, `D` <= 10,000
* Performance is measured with `D` = 128, `M` = 1,048,576
