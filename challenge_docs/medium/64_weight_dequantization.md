# Weight Dequantization

Implement a GPU program that "dequantizes" a weight matrix on the GPU. You are given an input matrix `X` of shape `[M, N]` containing quantized values and a scale matrix `S` of shape `[ceil(M/T), ceil(N/T)]`, where `T` is the tile size.

For each element $X\_{i,j}$, the corresponding scale factor is $S\_{row, col}$ where $row = \lfloor i / T \rfloor$ and $col = \lfloor j / T \rfloor$.
The output $Y\_{i,j}$ should be computed as:

$$
Y\_{i,j} = X\_{i,j} \times S\_{row, col}
$$

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the output buffer `Y`

## Example 1:

```
Input:
M = 4, N = 4, TILE_SIZE = 2
X = [
  [10, 10,  5,  5],
  [10, 10,  5,  5],
  [ 2,  2,  8,  8],
  [ 2,  2,  8,  8]
]
S = [
  [0.5, 2.0],
  [4.0, 0.25]
]

Output:
Y = [
  [ 5.0,  5.0, 10.0, 10.0],
  [ 5.0,  5.0, 10.0, 10.0],
  [ 8.0,  8.0,  2.0,  2.0],
  [ 8.0,  8.0,  2.0,  2.0]
]
Explanation:
Tile (0,0) of X is multiplied by S[0,0] (0.5).
Tile (0,1) of X is multiplied by S[0,1] (2.0).
Tile (1,0) is multiplied by S[1,0] (4.0).
Tile (1,1) is multiplied by S[1,1] (0.25).
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `M`, `N` <= 8192
* `TILE_SIZE` ∈ {16, 32, 64, 128}
* Performance is measured with `M` = 8,192, `N` = 8,192, `TILE_SIZE` = 128
