# FP16 Dot Product

Implement a GPU program that computes the dot product of two vectors containing 16-bit floating point numbers (FP16/`half`).
The dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of two vectors.

Mathematically, the dot product of two vectors $A$ and $B$ of length $n$ is defined as:

$$
A \cdot B = \sum\_{i=0}^{n-1} A\_i \cdot B\_i = A\_0 \cdot B\_0 + A\_1 \cdot B\_1 + \ldots + A\_{n-1} \cdot B\_{n-1}
$$

All inputs are stored as 16-bit floating point numbers (FP16/`half`). For best precision, accumulation during multiplication should use FP32 before converting the final result to FP16.

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* Accumulation during multiplication should use FP32 for better precision before converting the final result to FP16
* The final result must be stored in the output variable as `half`

## Example 1:

```
Input:  A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
               B = [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
       Output: result = 70.0  (1.0*5.0 + 2.0*6.0 + 3.0*7.0 + 4.0*8.0)
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:  A = [0.5, 1.5, 2.5]
               B = [2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
       Output: result = 15.5  (0.5*2.0 + 1.5*3.0 + 2.5*4.0)
```

## Constraints

* `A` and `B` have identical lengths
* 1 <= `N` <= 100,000,000
* Performance is measured with `N` = 100,000,000
