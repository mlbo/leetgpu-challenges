# Count 3D Array Element

Write a GPU program that counts the number of elements with the integer value p in an 3D array of 32-bit integers.
The program should count the number of elements with p in an 3D array.
You are given an input 3D array `input` of length `N x M x K` and integer `p`.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` variable

## Example 1:

```
Input: input [[[1, 2, 3],
               [4, 5, 1]],
              [[1, 1, 1],
               [2, 2, 2]]]
       N = 2, M = 2, K = 3
       p = 1
Output: output = 5
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: input [[[5, 10],
               [5, 2],
               [2, 2]]]
       N = 1, M = 3, K = 2
       p = 1
Output: output = 0
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N, M, K` <= 1,000
* 1 <= `input[i], p` <= 100
* Performance is measured with `K` = 500, `M` = 500, `N` = 500
