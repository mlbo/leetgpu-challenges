# Subarray Sum

Implement a program that computes the sum of a subarray of 32-bit integers.
You are given an input array `input` of length `N`, and two indices `S` and `E`.
`S` and `E` are inclusive, 0-based start and end indices — compute the sum of `input[S..E]`.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` variable

## Example 1:

```
Input: input = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4], S = 1, E = 3
Output: output = 6
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: input = [1, 2, 3, 4], S = 0, E = 3
Output: output = 10
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 100,000,000
* 1 <= `input[i]` <= 10
* 0 <= `S` <= `E` <= `N - 1`
* Performance is measured with `N` = 100,000,000
