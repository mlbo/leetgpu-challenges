# Stream Compaction

Given a 1D array `A` of `N` 32-bit floating point numbers, compact all
positive elements (`A[i] > 0`) to the front of the output array `out`,
preserving their original relative order. Fill any remaining positions with `0.0`.
Stream compaction is a fundamental GPU primitive used throughout rendering, sparse computation,
and collision detection.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native GPU features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The first *k* positions of `out` must contain the *k* elements of
  `A` where `A[i] > 0`, in their original order
* Positions *k* through *N−1* of `out` must be `0.0`
* Elements where `A[i] = 0.0` are **not** selected

## Example

```
Input:  A = [1.0, -2.0, 3.0, 0.0, -1.0, 4.0]
Output: out = [1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 100,000,000
* −1000.0 <= `A[i]` <= 1000.0
* `out` is pre-allocated with `N` elements, initialised to `0.0`
* Performance is measured with `N` = 50,000,000
