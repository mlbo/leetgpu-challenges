# Ordinary Least Squares

Solve the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression problem on a GPU. Given a feature matrix $X$ of size $n\\_samples \times n\\_features$ and a target vector $y$ of size $n\\_samples$, compute the coefficient vector $\beta$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals:

$$
\min\_{\beta} ||X\beta - y||^2
$$

The closed-form solution to OLS is:

$$
\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
$$

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted.
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged.
* The final coefficients must be stored in the `beta` vector.
* Assume that the feature matrix $X$ is full rank (i.e., $X^TX$ is invertible).

## Example:

Input:  
$X$ (samples × features):

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-0.23 & -0.23 & 1.52 \\
0.77 & -0.47 & 1.58 \\
-0.14 & 0.65 & 0.5 \\
-1.91 & -1.72 & 0.24 \\
-0.46 & -0.47 & 0.54
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$y$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
83.01 \\
93.4 \\
47.33 \\
-62.22 \\
13.06
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Output:  
$\beta$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
13.97 \\
29.12 \\
61.05
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Constraints

* 1 <= `n_samples` <= 100,000
* 1 <= `n_features` <= 1,000
* `n_samples` >= `n_features`
* -1000.0 <= values in `X` and `y` <= 1000.0
* Solutions are tested with absolute tolerance of 1e-2 and relative tolerance of 1e-2
* Performance is measured with `n_features` = 32, `n_samples` = 32
