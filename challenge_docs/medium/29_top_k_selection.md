# Top K Selection

Implement a GPU program that, given a 1D array `input` of 32-bit floating point numbers of length `N`, selects the `k` largest elements and writes them in descending order to the `output` array of length `k`.

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` array

## Example 1:

```
  Input:
  input = [1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0]
  N = 5
  k = 3

  Output:
  output = [5.0, 4.0, 3.0]
```

## Example 2:

```
  Input:
  input = [7.2, -1.0, 3.3, 8.8, 2.2]
  N = 5
  k = 2

  Output:
  output = [8.8, 7.2]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= N <= 100,000,000
* 1 <= k <= N
* All values in `input` are 32-bit floats
* Performance is measured with `N` = 50,000,000, `k` = 100
