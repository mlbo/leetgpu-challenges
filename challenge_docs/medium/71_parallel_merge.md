# Parallel Merge

Given two sorted arrays `A` of length `M` and `B` of length
`N`, both containing 32-bit floating-point values in non-decreasing order, produce a
single sorted array `C` of length `M + N` containing all elements of
`A` and `B` in non-decreasing order.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only GPU native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final merged result must be stored in `C`

## Example

```
Input:
  A = [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0],  M = 4
  B = [2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0],  N = 4

Output:
  C = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
```

```
Input:
  A = [-1.0, 1.0, 3.0],  M = 3
  B = [2.0],             N = 1

Output:
  C = [-1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `M`, `N` <= 50,000,000
* `M + N` <= 50,000,000
* Both `A` and `B` are sorted in non-decreasing order
* Elements are 32-bit floats
* Performance is measured with `M` = 25,000,000, `N` = 25,000,000
