# 1D Convolution

Implement a program that performs a 1D convolution operation. Given an input array and a kernel (filter), compute the convolved
output. The convolution should be performed with a "valid" boundary condition, meaning the kernel is only applied
where it fully overlaps with the input.

The input consists of two arrays:

* `input`: A 1D array of 32-bit floating-point numbers.
* `kernel`: A 1D array of 32-bit floating-point numbers representing the convolution kernel.

The output should be written to the `output` array, which will have a size of `input_size - kernel_size + 1`.

The convolution operation is defined mathematically as:

$$
output[i] = \sum\_{j=0}^{kernel\\_size-1} input[i + j] \cdot kernel[j]
$$

where $i$ ranges from 0 to $input\\_size - kernel\\_size$.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The
  `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the array
  `output`

## Example 1:

```
Input: input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], kernel = [1, 0, -1]
Output: [-2, -2, -2]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: input = [2, 4, 6, 8], kernel = [0.5, 0.2]
Output: [1.8, 3.2, 4.6]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `input_size` <= 1,500,000
* 1 <= `kernel_size` <= 2047
* `kernel_size` <= `input_size`
* Performance is measured with `input_size` = 1,500,000, `kernel_size` = 2,047
