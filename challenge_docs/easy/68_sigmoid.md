# Sigmoid Activation

Write a GPU program that applies the sigmoid activation function element-wise to a vector of
32-bit floating point numbers. For each element `x` in the input vector `X`,
compute `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))` and store the result in the output vector
`Y`. The sigmoid function maps any real number to the range (0, 1).

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in vector `Y`

## Example 1:

```
Input:  X = [0.0, 1.0, -1.0, 2.0]
Output: Y = [0.5, 0.7311, 0.2689, 0.8808]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:  X = [0.5, -0.5, 3.0, -3.0]
Output: Y = [0.6225, 0.3775, 0.9526, 0.0474]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 100,000,000
* Input values are finite 32-bit floating point numbers
* Performance is measured with `N` = 50,000,000
