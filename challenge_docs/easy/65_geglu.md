# Gaussian Error Gated Linear Unit

Implement the Gaussian Error Gated Linear Unit (GEGLU) activation function forward pass for 1D input
vectors. Given an input tensor of shape [N] where N is the number of elements, compute the output
using the elementwise formula. The input and output tensor must be of type `float32`.

GEGLU is defined as:

1. Split input $x$ into two halves: $x\_1$ and $x\_2$
2. Compute GELU on the second half:
   
$$
\text{GELU}(x\_2) = \frac{1}{2} x\_2 \left(1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x\_2}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right)
$$

3. Compute the GEGLU output:
   
$$
\text{GEGLU}(x\_1, x\_2) = x\_1 \cdot \text{GELU}(x\_2)
$$

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` tensor

## Example 1:

```
Input:  [1.0, 1.0]  (N=2)
Output: [0.8413447]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:  [2.0, -1.0, 1.0, 0.5]  (N=4)
Output: [1.6826895, -0.3457312]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 1,000,000
* N is an even number
* -100.0 <= input values <= 100.0
* Performance is measured with `N` = 1,000,000
