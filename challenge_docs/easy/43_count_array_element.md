# Count Array Element

Write a GPU program that counts the number of elements with the integer value k in an array of 32-bit integers.
The program should count the number of elements with k in an array.
You are given an input array `input` of length `N` and integer `k`.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` variable

## Example 1:

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1], k = 1
Output: 2
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: [5, 10, 5, 2], k = 11
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= `N` <= 100,000,000
* 1 <= `input[i], k` <= 100,000
* Performance is measured with `K` = 501,010, `N` = 100,000,000
